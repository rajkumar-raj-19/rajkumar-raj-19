# Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:

🔭 **I’m currently working as a Backend Admin at Idea's For Transformation.**
🌱 **Interests**
I’m passionate about **Full Stack Development and System Design.**

🙍‍♂️ **In a nutshell**
I am an IT professional with experience in technical support and backend administration. I specialize in building secure full-stack applications using the **Spring ecosystem**, bridging the gap between legacy databases like **Oracle 10g** and modern identity providers. I am a quick learner who is focused on keeping systems running smoothly and helping users effectively.

⚡ **Fun fact**
* 🤖 **The Hardware Wizard:** Apart from coding, I built an **Arduino-based obstacle detection system**—it’s great at detecting physical obstacles, now I'm teaching it to find bugs in my code!
* 🍔 **Burger Tech:** I handle IT operations for **McDonald's stores.** If your midnight burger order goes through smoothly, you're welcome!
* 🔐 **Legacy Whisperer:** I enjoy making **Oracle 10g** play nice with **Google OAuth2.** It's like teaching a classic car to drive itself!
