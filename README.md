# Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:

[cite_start]🔭 **I’m currently working as a Backend Admin at Idea's For Transformation.** [cite: 9]
🌱 **Interests**
[cite_start]I’m passionate about **Backend Development, System Design, and Secure Architectures.** [cite: 4, 24]

🙍‍♂️ **In a nutshell**
[cite_start]I am an IT professional with experience in technical support and backend administration[cite: 5, 9]. [cite_start]I specialize in building secure full-stack applications using the **Spring ecosystem**, bridging the gap between legacy databases like **Oracle 10g** and modern identity providers[cite: 23, 24, 33]. [cite_start]I am a quick learner who is focused on keeping systems running smoothly and helping users effectively[cite: 7].

⚡ **Fun fact**
* [cite_start]🤖 **The Hardware Wizard:** Apart from coding, I built an **Arduino-based obstacle detection system** [cite: 9]—it’s great at detecting physical obstacles, now I'm teaching it to find bugs in my code!
* [cite_start]🍔 **Burger Tech:** I handle IT operations for **McDonald's stores**[cite: 9]. If your midnight burger order goes through smoothly, you're welcome! 
* [cite_start]🔐 **Legacy Whisperer:** I enjoy making **Oracle 10g** play nice with **Google OAuth2**[cite: 24, 28]. It's like teaching a classic car to drive itself!
